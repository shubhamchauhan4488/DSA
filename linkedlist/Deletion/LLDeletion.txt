// Deletion

// Delete at the Head

// Delete at the tail

// Delete at 'K'th position 

// Delete at 'K'th position from the end
Problem statement

You have been given a singly Linked List of 'N' nodes with integer data and an integer 'K'.


Your task is to remove the 'K'th node from the end of the given Linked List and return the head of the modified linked list.


Example:

Input : 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 'NULL'  and  'K' = 2
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 'NULL'
Explanation:
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list become 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 'NULL'.

Sample Input 1 :

6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 

Sample Output 1 :

1 2 3 5 6

Explanation for Sample Input 1:

In the given linked list the node with data ‘4’ will be removed as this is the 3rd node from the end of the Linked List.

Sample Input 2 :

3 3
1 2 3

Sample Output 2 :

2 3

Constraints :

1 <= 'N' <= 10^3
1 <= 'K' <= 'N'
1 <= 'data' <= 10^3

Time Limit: 1 sec.
